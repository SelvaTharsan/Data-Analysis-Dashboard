<h2>Project Insight</h2>

- Sales Performance: Sales in 2022 exceeded the target in every month except for January and February. The sales remained consistently strong, with figures mostly above $200M each month.

- Profit Analysis: Profit figures generally mirrored the sales trend. However, the profit margin was lower than expected, especially in the months where sales were higher than the target.

- Customer Analysis: Customer numbers fell short of the target by around 13%, which may suggest that while sales are strong, customer acquisition strategies could be improved to meet targets.
  
- Country-Specific Sales: The highest sales were recorded in Argentina, with a significant figure of $953.3M, followed by Brazil and Colombia. These markets performed well in terms of sales in 2022, contributing heavily to the total revenue.
  
- Customer Satisfaction: Customer satisfaction scores are relatively high, particularly in the areas of product quality, hygiene, and availability, with scores of 86%, 93%, and 95%, respectively. However, thereâ€™s a need for improvement in speed and service, with scores of 54% and 53%.

<h2>Final Conclusion</h2>

To maximize sales and customer satisfaction in 2023, a focused approach is needed for enhancing customer acquisition, particularly in regions where sales are lower. The sales strategy should emphasize markets like Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, where performance has been strong. Customer satisfaction improvements should be targeted at the speed and service areas, as these are the weakest links in customer experience. In parallel, marketing efforts should be directed towards countries with underperforming customer metrics and improving delivery and service quality. This comprehensive approach will help bridge the gap between sales targets and actual customer acquisition, ultimately driving both profitability and brand loyalty.
